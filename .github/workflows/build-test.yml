# This workflow runs on every push and pull request to test that the engine
# compiles successfully on both Windows and Linux platforms. It helps catch
# build issues early before they make it into releases.
#
# Build artifacts are uploaded and retained for 7 days for testing purposes.
# For production releases, see build-release.yml workflow.
