### Build Instructions

#### Windows (Visual Studio)

##### Prerequisites Verification

**⚠️ BEFORE YOU START:** Make sure you have all prerequisites installed. If anything is missing, refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for installation help.

Before building, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Git for Windows**
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and run `git --version`
   - You should see something like `git version 2.x.x`

2. **CMake 3.15 or higher**
   - Download from: https://cmake.org/download/ (Windows x64 Installer)
   - **Important**: During installation, select "Add CMake to system PATH for all users"
   - Verify installation: Run `cmake --version` in Command Prompt
   - You should see `cmake version 3.15.0` or higher

3. **Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.8+, including 17.14.x) or Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.11+)**
   - **Tested:** Visual Studio Community 2022 versions 17.8 through 17.14 (all supported)
   - **Alternative:** Visual Studio Community 2019 version 16.11 or newer
   - Download Community Edition (free) from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
   - During installation, select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
   - This installs the C++ compiler (MSVC v143/v142), Windows SDK, and build tools
   - **📖 See [VISUAL_STUDIO_SETUP.md](VISUAL_STUDIO_SETUP.md) for step-by-step installation guide with visual diagrams**

##### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

```bash
# Clone with --recursive flag to download all submodules (GLFW, GLM, Assimp)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/shifty81/GameEngine.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd GameEngine
```

**Note**: The `--recursive` flag is essential as it downloads all required third-party libraries (GLFW, GLM, Assimp) from their Git submodules. Without it, the build will fail.

**If you already cloned without `--recursive`**, run:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**⚠️ Troubleshooting:** If you get "Could not find GLFW/GLM/Assimp" errors later, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#error-could-not-find-glfw-or-could-not-find-glm-or-could-not-find-assimp).

##### Step 2: Create Build Directory

CMake uses out-of-source builds to keep generated files separate from source code:

```bash
# Create a build directory
mkdir build

# Navigate into it
cd build
```

**Why separate build directory?** This keeps all build artifacts (object files, executables, project files) separate from source code, making it easy to clean and rebuild.

##### Step 3: Generate Visual Studio Project Files

Run CMake to generate Visual Studio solution and project files:

```bash
# Generate Visual Studio project files
cmake ..
```

**What this does**:
- Analyzes `CMakeLists.txt` in the parent directory (`..`)
- Detects your Visual Studio version automatically
- Configures all dependencies (OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, Assimp)
- Creates `GameEngine.sln` (Visual Studio solution file)
- Creates `.vcxproj` files for each target

**Expected output**:
```
-- The CXX compiler identification is MSVC ...
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: .../GameEngine/build
```

**If CMake cannot find Visual Studio**, you can specify the generator explicitly:
```bash
# For Visual Studio 2022:
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..

# For Visual Studio 2019:
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..

# For Visual Studio 2017:
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64 ..
```

**⚠️ If you see "No CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER could be found":** This is the most common error! It means Visual Studio is installed but the C++ compiler is not. See the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below or [WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the complete fix.

##### Step 4: Build the Project

You have two options:

**Option A: Build from Command Line** (Recommended for automation)

```bash
# Build Release configuration (optimized, fast)
cmake --build . --config Release

# This will:
# - Compile all .cpp files
# - Link libraries (OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, Assimp)
# - Create GameEngine.exe in build/bin/Release/
```

**Build time**: First build takes 5-15 minutes (compiles Assimp and GLFW). Subsequent builds are much faster.

For **Debug** builds (with debugging symbols, slower runtime):
```bash
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

**Option B: Build in Visual Studio IDE** (Better for development and debugging)

1. Open `GameEngine.sln` in the `build` directory
2. In Visual Studio, select **Release** configuration from the dropdown at the top (or Debug if you need debugging)
3. Right-click the **GameEngine** project in Solution Explorer → **Set as Startup Project**
4. Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** or go to **Build → Build Solution** (or press F7)
5. Wait for compilation to complete (status bar shows progress)

**Advantages of building in Visual Studio**:
- Better error visualization and IntelliSense
- Built-in debugger (F5 to run with debugging)
- Easy navigation through code
- Integrated profiling tools

##### Step 5: Run the Executable

After a successful build:

**From Command Line**:
```bash
# Run Release build
.\bin\Release\GameEngine.exe

# Or run Debug build
.\bin\Debug\GameEngine.exe
```

**From Visual Studio**:
- Press **F5** (run with debugger) or **Ctrl+F5** (run without debugger)

**From Windows Explorer**:
- Navigate to `GameEngine\build\bin\Release\`
- Double-click `GameEngine.exe`

The game engine window should open displaying a procedurally generated 3D world with terrain and water!

##### Automated Setup (Recommended for First-Time Users)

For the easiest setup experience, use the automated setup script:

```bash
# From GameEngine root directory
setup.bat
```

This script automatically:
1. Checks for Git installation
2. Checks for CMake (offers to download portable version if missing)
3. **Detects Visual Studio 2022 and C++ compiler installation**
4. **Offers to automatically fix compiler issues**
5. Initializes git submodules
6. Provides clear next steps

**Features**:
- Automatic compiler detection using advanced diagnostics
- One-click fix for missing C++ components
- Downloads portable CMake if needed (no PATH configuration required)
- Comprehensive error messages with actionable solutions

After setup completes, simply run:
```bash
build.bat
```

##### Quick Build (Alternative Method)

For convenience, use the provided batch script:

```bash
# From GameEngine root directory
build.bat
```

This script automatically:
1. **Checks for Visual Studio C++ compiler issues (with optional auto-fix)**
2. Updates git submodules
3. Creates build directory
4. Runs CMake configuration
5. Builds Release configuration
6. Reports success/failure

To run the engine:
```bash
run.bat
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** For comprehensive troubleshooting guidance, see:
- **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Cross-platform troubleshooting guide
- **[WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Windows-specific issues and solutions

**Problem**: "No CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER could be found" or "The CXX compiler identification is unknown"
- **Cause**: Visual Studio is installed but the C++ compiler (MSVC) is not installed
- **Quick Fix**: Run the automated compiler detection tool:
  ```batch
  tools\check-vs2022-compiler.bat
  ```
  This will diagnose the issue and provide specific fix instructions. Use the `-autofix` flag to automatically open Visual Studio Installer:
  ```batch
  tools\check-vs2022-compiler.bat -autofix
  ```
- **Manual Solution**: 
  1. Open **Visual Studio Installer** (search in Start menu)
  2. Click **"Modify"** on your Visual Studio installation
  3. Select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload (checkbox on the left)
  4. Click **"Modify"** button at bottom right to install
  5. Wait for installation to complete (may take 10-15 minutes)
  6. Delete the `build` folder in your GameEngine directory
  7. Run `build.bat` again
- **Alternative**: If you don't have Visual Studio, download Community Edition (free):
  - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
  - During installation, select **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
- **Note**: This error means CMake found Visual Studio but the actual C++ compiler tools aren't installed. The "Desktop development with C++" workload includes cl.exe (C++ compiler), MSBuild, and Windows SDK.
- **See Also**: For comprehensive troubleshooting, see [WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Problem**: "CMake is not recognized as an internal or external command"
- **Cause**: CMake is not in your system PATH, or is installed in a custom location
- **Quick Fix**: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#error-cmake-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command) for detailed solutions
- **Solution Option 1 - Reinstall CMake with PATH**:
  1. Reinstall CMake from https://cmake.org/download/
  2. During installation, select **"Add CMake to the system PATH for all users"** or **"Add CMake to the system PATH for the current user"**
  3. Restart Command Prompt and try again
- **Solution Option 2 - Manually Add CMake to PATH** (for custom installations like `C:\make\`):
  1. Press **Windows + R**, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter
  2. Click **"Environment Variables"** button (bottom right)
  3. Under **"System variables"** (or "User variables"), find and select **"Path"**
  4. Click **"Edit"**
  5. Click **"New"** and add your CMake bin directory:
     - If CMake is at `C:\make\`, add: `C:\make\bin`
     - If CMake is at `C:\Program Files\CMake\`, add: `C:\Program Files\CMake\bin`
     - Make sure to add the `bin` subdirectory where `cmake.exe` is located
  6. Click **"OK"** on all dialogs
  7. **Restart your Command Prompt or PowerShell** (environment changes require a new session)
  8. Verify: Run `cmake --version` - you should see your CMake version (e.g., 4.2.0 or 3.20+)
- **Solution Option 3 - Use Full Path**:
  - Instead of running `cmake ..`, use the full path: `C:\make\bin\cmake.exe ..`
- **Note**: The PATH variable tells Windows where to find executable files. Without it, you must use the full path to cmake.exe every time

**Problem**: "Could not find Visual Studio" or Visual Studio compiler detection issues
- **Quick Fix**: Run the compiler detection diagnostic tool:
  ```batch
  tools\check-vs2022-compiler.bat
  ```
  This comprehensive tool will:
  - Detect Visual Studio 2022 installation
  - Verify C++ compiler (MSVC) is installed
  - Check for required components (C++ build tools, Windows SDK)
  - Provide specific fix instructions with component names
  - Optionally auto-launch Visual Studio Installer to fix issues
- **Manual Solution**: Install Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" workload, or specify generator with `-G` flag

**For more details on the compiler detection tool**, see [tools/README.md](tools/README.md)

**Problem**: "LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'opengl32.lib'"
- **Solution**: Windows SDK is missing. Reinstall Visual Studio and ensure Windows SDK is selected in the installer
- **Detailed Steps**: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#error-link--fatal-error-lnk1104-cannot-open-file-opengl32lib)

**Problem**: Build fails with "Cannot find GLFW" or "Cannot find GLM"
- **Solution**: Submodules were not initialized. Run:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
  Then delete `build` directory and start over from Step 2
- **More Info**: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#error-could-not-find-glfw-or-could-not-find-glm-or-could-not-find-assimp)

**Problem**: "GameEngine.exe - System Error: The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found"
- **Solution**: Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:
  - Download from: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
  - Run installer and restart

**Problem**: Long build time (>20 minutes)
- **Expected**: First build compiles Assimp (~3000 files) and takes 10-15 minutes
- **Speed up**: Use `cmake --build . --config Release -j 8` to build with 8 parallel jobs
- **Alternative**: Subsequent rebuilds only take 10-30 seconds

**Problem**: Black screen or window doesn't open

## 🔧 Continuous Integration

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and binary builds:

### Build Testing
Every push and pull request automatically triggers the **Build Test** workflow:
- ✅ **Windows Build Test** - Validates compilation with Visual Studio 2022
- ✅ **Linux Build Test** - Validates compilation with GCC on Ubuntu
- ✅ **Build Artifacts** - Uploads test binaries for verification (7-day retention)
- 🔗 **View Build Status**: Check the badge at the top of this README

### Release Builds
Tagged releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`) automatically trigger the **Build and Release** workflow:
- 📦 Creates production-ready binaries for Windows and Linux
- 🚀 Publishes binaries to GitHub Releases
- ✨ Includes all assets and documentation
- 🔗 **See**: [DOWNLOAD_BINARIES.md](DOWNLOAD_BINARIES.md) for download instructions

**Note**: Build test artifacts are available in the Actions tab for 7 days after each build.

## Extending the Engine

### Loading 3D Models (Stylized Nature Kit)

```cpp
#include "AssetManager.h"

// Get asset manager instance
AssetManager* assetMgr = AssetManager::GetInstance();

// Load a tree model from your nature kit
auto treeModel = assetMgr->LoadModel("assets/models/nature/tree_01.fbx", "oak_tree");

// Load a rock model
auto rockModel = assetMgr->LoadModel("assets/models/nature/rock_01.obj", "granite_rock");

// Render in your game loop
shader.use();
shader.setMat4("model", transform);
treeModel->Draw(shader);
```

See **ASSET_PIPELINE.md** for complete integration guide.

### Integrating itch.io Assets

Easily drop in assets downloaded from itch.io:

**Step 1:** Download asset pack from [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets)

**Step 2:** Extract and copy to your project:
```bash
# Copy models to assets folder
cp downloaded_pack/models/* GameEngine/assets/models/

# Copy textures
cp downloaded_pack/textures/* GameEngine/assets/textures/
```

**Step 3:** Load and use in your game:
```cpp
// Load the itch.io assets
auto model = AssetManager::GetInstance()->LoadModel(
    "assets/models/tree.fbx", 
    "tree"
);

// Render in game loop
shader.use();
shader.setMat4("model", transform);
model->Draw(shader);
```

See **ITCHIO_ASSETS.md** for complete guide including:
- Organizing large asset collections
- Fixing coordinate system mismatches
- Handling scale issues
- Performance optimization
- Recommended asset packs

### Adding New Features
The engine is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **New Objects**: Create classes similar to `Terrain` or `Water`
2. **Custom Shaders**: Add new shader pairs in `main.cpp`
3. **New Systems**: Follow the pattern of `Wind.h` for new systems
4. **Custom Textures**: Replace files in `textures/` directory or use Asset Manager
5. **3D Models**: Place in `assets/` and load with Asset Manager

### Windmill Implementation (Future)
The wind system is already prepared for windmills:
```cpp
float rotation = wind.getWindmillRotation();
// Apply rotation to windmill model
```

## Performance

- Optimized mesh generation
- Efficient OpenGL buffer usage
- Configurable terrain resolution
- Level of detail system ready for implementation
